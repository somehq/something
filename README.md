This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting started

We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the preferred package manager for this project.

To install pnpm globally on your system, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Run the following command on your local environment:

```bash
# If you using pnpm:
pnpm create next-app something --example "https://github.com/somehq/something"
# or
npx create-next-app something --example "https://github.com/somehq/something"
```

```bash
cd something
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see something :wink:. 

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
